      "body": "Audits. Nobody likes them, am I right? \n\nI get it. I really do. But audits serve a purpose – and if your business is closed right now because of the COVID-19 pandemic, then this is the perfect time to change ‘audit’ from a dirty word to a tool that can help your business thrive. \n\nNot sure how? The good news is, it’s easy to do. Your business could probably use some fine-tuning, and an internal audit of your resources and processes can help you get everything in order so, when you do reopen, you’ll be more successful than ever. Here’s what you’ll need to do. \n\nWebsite Review \n\nSince your website is your online HQ, it’s a good place to start your audit. You may want to review your competitors’ websites to get a handle on what they’re doing. Then make note of anything that’s outdated or not working the way it should, including: \n\nYour site’s design \n\nMobile accessibility \n\nNavigation \n\nSite speed \n\nBroken/outdated links \n\nSEO \n\nYour focus should be on making your site as fast, accessible, and useful as possible. Anything that slows down or negatively impacts the user experience should be improved. \n\nOn a more topical note, many businesses have altered their hours and offerings because of the COVID-19 pandemic. If you have, your website should reflect the changes. \n\nOnline Ordering \n\nDo you have an online store? If you do, then you should look at every aspect of it from your product listings and design to the functionality of ordering. \n\nHow easy is it for customers to order online? Is your store just as functional for mobile users as it is for people on a computer? Is the checkout process intuitive? \n\nOrdering and payments – which we’ll talk about next – are two areas where I think it’s worthwhile to pay for some user testing. There are plenty of sites where the ordering process is convoluted. Customers hate that – which means you should, too. \n\nPayments \n\nI’m willing to bet that you’ve had the experience of adding something to your cart on a website, going to check out, and then abandoning your cart because the payment process was too annoying or laborious to handle. \n\nBottom line – a difficult payment process is unacceptable. It will cost you sales and customers. \n\nYour focus should be on making the payment process an easy one. That may mean: \n\nIncreasing the security of your payment page by updating your security certificate, adding encryption, and including a statement about security to reassure your customers. \n\nAdding payment methods that are easy for customers to use, including credit cards, PayPal, eChecks, and mobile payments. \n\nKeeping your entire payment process on your site instead of asking customers to navigate away. \n\nMinimizing the number of steps in your checkout process. \n\nPaying for an online order should be quick, easy, and intuitive. Nobody should have to guess what to do or be left wondering whether their payment went through. \n\nProducts and Services \n\nThis might not seem like the right time to revamp your products or services, but you’re already auditing... right? \n\nConsider asking your followers on social media what, if anything, they’d change about your products. Are there features they want added? Is there an auxiliary product you could sell? \n\nYou may not be able to afford a full product update, but it’s still a good idea to take a step back and use this opportunity to evaluate your products and see what you can do to make them more appealing to the people in your target audience. \n\nLoyalty Programs \n\nLoyalty programs are popular for a reason. I’ve written about them before. If you don’t have one – or if it’s been a while since you thought about it – this is the perfect time to review it to see if it can be made better. \n\nYou might need an overhaul if your loyalty program: \n\nIsn’t attracting new members \n\nOffers dated or sub-par rewards \n\nDoesn’t have a mobile option \n\nYour loyalty program should be appealing to your customers and provide something concrete in return for their loyalty. You can find a list of options to improve your loyalty program here. \n\nSEO/Online Presence \n\nWe’ve already talked about auditing your website, but what about the rest of the web? \n\nDon’t worry, you don’t need to audit the whole internet. That would take too long. But what you should do is to audit the rest of your online presence with an eye toward improving your local SEO. Here’s a checklist of what to do: \n\nReview your online listings in directories, guides, and other places to make sure your NAP (name, address, \u0026 phone number) are consistent. Even small differences, such as using Ave instead of Avenue, can dilute your online presence.) \n\nClaim your Google My Business listing and make sure your information (including Google Maps) is up-to-date. \n\nClaim any review site profiles you haven’t yet claimed and check all of them to ensure your information is accurate and current. \n\nUpdate photographs on review sites to reflect product updates or menu changes. \n\nReview your social media profiles and update them as needed. \n\nThese changes shouldn’t take long but they can make a big difference in your local SEO, making it easy for your business to rank on Google. \n\nEmail Marketing \n\nEmail marketing – well, you’re probably sick of hearing me talk about how much I love email marketing. The ROI is a great and it’s an inexpensive and effective way to communicate with your customers. \n\nHere are some things to review in your audit: \n\nYour opt-in form should be short and request only essential information. \n\nSubscribers who haven’t opened your emails in 6 months should be unsubscribed. Unless you’re using a free service, you’re paying to keep them on your list. \n\nReview (or create) a welcome sequence to send to new subscribers. \n\nConsider list segmentation to target your emails to the customers who are most likely to buy from you. \n\nIf you don’t already have an email list, this is the perfect time to build one. You can add a simple opt-in form to your site using a plugin. \n\nSocial Media \n\nWe already talked a little about updating your social media profiles, but there’s another angle you should consider during your audit. \n\nIt’s common for companies to think they need a presence on every social media site. That might not be true. \n\nFor example, say you’ve got a Twitter account that you’ve been using to no avail. If the ROI on your Twitter – factoring in ad spending and your time – is low, then you can simply deactivate your account. Or you can reconsider how you’re using it to improve your ROI. \n\nThe same is true of any other site. You’re better off having one or two active social media accounts than five that aren’t as good as they could be. \n\nIf your social media game is lacking, it’s an equally good time to set up a new account to market your business. If Twitter is underperforming, you might turn your focus to Instagram or Pinterest. \n\nInternal Processes and Procedures \n\nWhile the aforementioned all tie into your organization’s digital marketing efforts, you should also seriously consider auditing your internal processes and procedures, especially if it’s been a while since you’ve done so. Technology changes at a whirlwind pace, and new solutions are constantly being introduced into the marketplace, all with the end goal of streamlining how company’s operate to maximize efficiency. This digital transformation is literally changing the way organizations operate, so that employees are no longer married to monotonous manual tasks and can instead focus their efforts on more meaningful work that enhances the bottom line. \n\nBy conducting an audit, you’ll be able to quickly identify key areas for improvement. And from there, can start devising strategies to address them. It’s important to note, however, that many organizations struggle with strategy and implementation, and turn to outside company’s like Cavendish Wood to assist in the process. Regardless of whether you keep things in-house or use an outside 3rd party to assist in the process, this is an extremely critical piece of the audit puzzle, and one that should definitely not be overlooked. \n\nLooking Towards the Future \n\nAn audit might not sound like fun but doing one now can make a huge difference to the health and success of your business. \n\nWhat are you waiting for?

      "body": "You’ve got to spend money to make money. Right? \n\nWell... maybe. The truth is that it it’s not that simple. \n\nMany of the tried and true marketing tricks you read about do require a substantial budget. But some don’t. \n\nIn fact, there are ways to increase your sales even if you’re running on a shoestring budget. It’s all about getting creative and taking chances with your marketing where it makes sense to do so. \n\nSo, with that in mind, here are some super-effective marketing tricks that can help you grow your sales without blowing through your (small) budget. \n\nUse Customer Feedback to Create New Products or Services \n\nThis first technique can be free – or nearly free. Basically, what you’re doing is talking to your existing customers to find out what else you can do for them. \n\nLet’s look at a simple example. Say your company creates and prints custom business cards. By talking to your clients about their other printing needs, you may be able to attract additional business without spending anything on advertising. \n\nInstead of printing only business cards, you might find an opportunity to print letterhead and envelopes, too. That way, you increase the lifetime value of a single customer, and you can offer your expanded services to new customers, too. \n\nCreate a Promotion Schedule \n\nDo your existing customers know when you’ll be running a special? It might sound a bit mundane to run promotions on a schedule but doing so gives your customers something to look forward to. And, it increases the likelihood that they’ll buy from you regularly. \n\nThis technique is perfect for building customer loyalty, but it can also help you attract new business. When your existing clients know that a promotion is coming, they may be more inclined to tell their friends and colleagues about it. \n\nThis is another sales-growth technique that can be carried out for only a few dollars. You’ll want to advertise your promotion a bit. But, once you’re on a schedule – where, say, clients know that you run a promotion every other month – they’ll start to expect it. That means you won’t have to spend as much to promote it! \n\nCross-Promote Your Products with a Partner \n\nLocal businesses sometimes miss out on opportunities to team up to generate sales. Simply by scanning the membership list of your local Chamber of Commerce can provide you with plenty of opportunities to cross-promote your products or services. \n\nFor example, the owner of a catering company might pair up with a florist or party rental company and offer a special to attract new business. Planning an event can be pricy, and you can attract new clients by giving them an incentive to hire both companies to help them with their event. \n\nAnother option might be partnering with another business to create a night out. The owner of a restaurant might offer a free appetizer to people who come in with a ticket stub from the local movie theater. Don’t be afraid to get creative. Doing so can make your business the destination of choice for local patrons. \n\nRevamp Your Content to Focus on Customer Benefits \n\nOne of the biggest mistakes inexperienced marketers make is focusing too much on their product’s features and not enough on what the product can do for their customers. Fortunately, this is something you can fix with little to no money. \n\nThe first step is to audit your website’s content. If you find that you’re not talking about how your products or services can improve your target audience’s lives, revamp it so the focus is on them. You know your product is awesome, but you need to explain how buying it will benefit your customers. \n\nAfter that, you can use the same technique to rethink your social media marketing strategy. Focusing on benefits makes your content more shareable than it would be if you simply touted your products. You’re likely to see a bigger return on your investment because you’ll be enticing people to buy your product. \n\nBundle Products and Services \n\nEvery consumer likes to feel that they’ve gotten a bargain when they buy something. That’s true both in B2C and B2B marketing – and you can use it to your advantage. \n\nThere are two ways to approach product bundling. The first is to bundle a basic product with some upgrades and add-ons and offer a price that’s slightly lower than what it would cost to buy everything separately. \n\nThe other option is to bundle products that go together in some way. A gift basket is a good example, and businesses use this technique around the holidays. For example, a Valentine’s Day bundle might include perfume, scented lotion, and a candle. \n\nIncrease Engagement on Social Media \n\nMany companies make the mistake of not trying to engage their social media followers when they promote content. That’s a mistake – and in a way, implementing this technique can save you money by increasing your ROI on social media. \n\nOne simple technique is to ask your audience a question. Everything you post should include a call to action. When you ask a question, you encourage your followers to respond. The question might be asking their opinion about something you post, or you might ask them which question they’d most like to have you answer in a future post. \n\nEither way, you’re not taking your audience for granted. Getting your social media to engage with you by providing valuable content triggers the cognitive bias called Reciprocity. That’s where people feel obligated to return the favor when you give them something for free. \n\nNurture Your Leads \n\nYou probably already have an email list – but are you using it well? A lot of businesses aren’t — and revamping your technique can make a huge difference in your sales. \n\nIf you’re emailing subscribers rarely, you’re missing out. Most email automation services charge based on the number of subscribers you have. That means you won’t pay any more for increasing the frequency of your emails. \n\nTry creating one or more email sequences, also known as a drip campaign. Focus on explaining the benefits of buying your product, and you’ll likely see an increase in your sales, too. \n\nMarketing Isn’t Just for Millionaires... \n\n... and you don’t have to double your budget to double your sales. Using the simple, inexpensive techniques outlined here can help you grow your business without busting your budget. ",

      "body": "How long has it been since you did anything with your company Facebook page (or Twitter or Instagram)? \n\nIf it’s been a long time, then you might feel stuck. How can you resurrect your social media presence? Is it possible? Should you bother? \n\nThe short answer is yes, it’s possible. You’ll need to be methodical and persistent. Here’s what you’ll need to do. \n\nUpdate Your Page \n\nThe first step is to update your page. Look at your profile and make sure that it includes: \n\nThe full name of your business \n\nYour address \n\nYour telephone number \n\nThe URL of your website \n\nYour email address \n\nYou should also update any additional information that’s outdated. For example, if you’ve changed your logo then you should add your new one. Have a new sign in front of your store? Take a new picture and post it. \n\nDecide on Social Media Goals \n\nThe next step is to set some reachable goals for your social media marketing. Marketing is most effective when you have a clearly defined goals – something you want to achieve with your social media presence. Here are some examples: \n\nIncrease your social media following and build your brand \n\nGet more readers for your blog \n\nIncrease your views on YouTube \n\nBuild your list \n\nBy articulating your goals, you’ll be able to steer your social media pages in the direction you want to go. \n\nCreate Original Content \n\nIf you’re going to reach any marketing goal using social media, you need original content to do it. You don’t need to spend a lot of money on content creation, but you do need to keep your brand and goals in mind. \n\nOriginal content can take many forms, including: \n\nFacebook status updates \n\nWritten content (blogs, articles, white pages, etc.) \n\nPhotographs \n\nGraphic content, including illustrations, infographics and cartoons) \n\nVideo content \n\nMemes \n\nYour content should always speak to your brand and the way you want your audience to think of you. In other words, it’s not a good idea to create cat memes unless cats are relevant to your brand. \n\nKeep in mind that you can create original content on your own or hire someone to do it for you. For example, you can hire a freelance writer for your blog or commission a graphic designer to make infographics for you. \n\nYou should intersperse original content with curated content that you get from relevant websites and publications. Always be sure to put your own spin on the curated content you share. \n\nCreate a Content Posting Schedule \n\nSocial media marketing is about consistency – and that means you’ll need a schedule to follow when you post social media content. The good news is that there are lots of tools that can help you set up and stick to a schedule. \n\nFacebook has built-in scheduling tools that you can use to set up posts ahead of time. The one thing I don’t like about it is that you can’t share posts from other pages on a schedule. You’ll need to open and copy the link to use the scheduling tool. \n\nIf you’ve got a social media presence on more than one site – say Facebook, Instagram and Pinterest – then you may want to consider using a paid social media scheduling tool to help you keep track of everything. I like Hootsuite because it allows you to schedule posts and track their performance. \n\nSpeaking of scheduling, it’s a good idea to think about your posting frequency as well as your content. You should post: \n\n1 or 2 times a day to Facebook \n\n5-10 times a day to Twitter \n\n1 to 2 times a day to Instagram \n\n5-30 times a day to Pinterest \n\n20 times per month (once per business day) to Linked In \n\n2 or 3 times a week to YouTube \n\nThat might seem like a lot but check out the next step for tips on how to keep your social media marketing work manageable. \n\nEliminate Pages Based on Performance \n\nWhat if you don’t have time to manage a Facebook page, an Instagram feed and a YouTube channel for your business? \n\nI’ve got good news for you: you don’t need to. You are perfectly within your rights to choose to focus on just a few social media sites and let the rest go. If you have pages set up on Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram, YouTube and LinkedIn and only your Facebook and Instagram pages are generating significant income, you can (and should) simply deactivate your other accounts. \n\nWhy? Because a dormant or inactive page is worse than no page at all. If people find you on YouTube and see what you haven’t posted a new video in years, it’s not going to impress them. There’s no rule saying you must be active on every social media site – so don’t be. Pick the sites that give you the biggest ROI and let the rest go. \n\nFocus on Engagement \n\nEngagement is what happens when someone comments on your post, shares it with their followers, or clicks on a link. In the world of social media marketing, nothing else matters. \n\nHere are some pointers to help you engage with your social media followers: \n\nAsk questions and respond when people answer \n\nMonitor your social media mentions and engage with people who talk about your company \n\nUse hashtags wisely – for example, getting involved in social media community tags such as #ThrowbackThursday can help attract new followers \n\nEncourage participation by holding contests or requesting user-generated content \n\nThe more you can get people to interact with your content, the more organic traffic you’ll get. \n\nTrack Your Results \n\nFinally, you should track your results on social media and refine your strategy based on what you learn. For example, you might notice that when you post a video on Facebook, it gets 10 times the engagement of your written content. That’s useful information because it tells you that it’s a good investment to make more videos. \n\nMetrics can also tell you: \n\nWhat times of day and days of the week your followers are online \n\nWhat topics your audience wants to hear about \n\nWhich social media pages get you the most traffic and sales \n\nUsing that information, you can refine and update your overall social media strategy and your marketing goals to give you the best possible chance of success. \n\nThe bottom line is that it’s never too late to bring your social media presence back from the dead. The key is to be practical, methodical and realistic – and to listen to your audience! ",

      "body": "Local businesses have special marketing challenges. Namely, it’s your job as a business owner to make sure that the people who are most likely to patronize your business – the people who live in your service area – know what you have to offer and where to find you. \n\nOne way to accomplish that goal is to use geolocation marketing. Here’s what you need to know. \n\nWhat Is Geolocation Marketing? \n\nLet’s start with the basics. Geolocation marketing is a type of marketing that’s location specific. By that, I mean that you can connect with potential customers who are near your business and target them directly with offers and ads. \n\nThe benefits of geolocation marketing are clear: \n\nYou’ll have access to a highly targeted audience of people who are likely to frequent your business \n\nYou can attract new customers by reaching out to them with offers that appeal directly to them \n\nYou can learn about the shopping habits and preferences of your existing customers and use what you learn to grow your business \n\nYou can reward your most loyal customers with special content and offers designed to turn them into brand ambassadors \n\nIn other words, geolocation marketing can help you to tap into a resource base of your existing customers and potential customers in your area, allowing you to connect with them and market your business in a way that’s likely to yield a high return on your investment. \n\nTools to Use for Geolocation Marketing for Your Business \n\nThere are three kinds of geolocation marketing that you can use depending upon your needs. They are: \n\n1. Geotargeting. This is the broadest form of geolocation marketing. It uses the IP addresses of your customers’ web browsers. In practical terms, you can’t use geotargeting for precise target audiences because it can’t pinpoint your audience’s location exactly. It’s best suited for marketing to general regions, cities, or states. \n\n2. Geofencing. is more precise than geotargeting, allowing you to target specific neighborhoods and even streets. Don’t think that limits you, though – it can also be used for entire towns or cities. Geofencing uses mobile devices’ GPS locations instead of IP addresses. That means you can track your customers’ locations even if they move. It’s ideal for attracting foot traffic but not as effective for tailoring specific marketing campaigns to your target audience. \n\n3. Beacons. are by far the most specific option for geolocation marketing. A beacon is a small device that you’ll put inside or near your business. It collects data from Bluetooth signals in smartphones. They’re ideal for use in places with poor Wi-Fi reception because they’re used for close communication. The Bluetooth technology allows you to send messages and offers directly to customers who are in range. \n\nThe type of geolocation marketing you choose depends on what you hope to accomplish with it. If your business is highly dependent upon foot traffic, you may decide that geofencing is the most cost-effective and useful form of geolocation marketing. \n\nTips for Using Geolocation Marketing \n\nNow, let’s talk about some specific tips to help you make the most of geolocation marketing and grow your business. There are lots of ways you can use this technology. Here are some suggestions. \n\nTarget people in a venue or at an event. If yours is the type of business that relies on foot traffic and you’re near a popular event venue, such as a stadium or theater, you can set up a geofence to target people who are at the place you specify. For example, a bar could target concertgoers at a nearby theater. You can also use this option to target office complexes and neighborhoods. \n\nSet up a geofence in your delivery area. If you own a business that delivers – whether you’re delivering Thai food or furniture – you can easily use geofencing to target the people who live in the area you service. Those people are the most likely to buy from you and they may not know about your business – until you use geolocation marketing to tell them what you have to offer. \n\nUse geotargeting to map out your audience based on where they are. While geotargeting is a more “big picture” type of geolocation marketing, it can be extremely useful to help you find people who are nearby. For example, if you sell a luxury product, you can use geotargeting to get your message to people who live in upscale neighborhoods. \n\nUse a beacon to attract foot traffic to your store. What if you own a retail store or restaurant that relies heavily on foot traffic? You can set up a beacon to ping your customers when they’re in range and then target them with specific offers. For example, if you own a restaurant near a busy downtown area or office park, you can send out an offer about your happy hour, including information about special deals on appetizers and drinks. \n\nSpeaking of beacons, you can also use them to send you an alert when a repeat or loyal customer is in your store. Imagine how flattered and grateful your customers will be when you show up at the door to greet them by name and show them what you’ve got to offer! This is a terrific tool for personalized marketing that can turn loyal customers into brand ambassadors. \n\nUse geolocation marketing to learn about your target audience’s buying habits. For example, you might have a nearby competitor and use geotargeting to provide potential customers with an incentive to visit your business. \n\nThe bottom line here is that geolocation marketing allows local businesses to use GPS technology to connect directly with the customers – and potential customers – who are most likely to frequent their stores. \n\nThe key with geolocation marketing is to determine which method will deliver the returns you want. That means defining your marketing goals and choosing the tech that’ll allow you to achieve them, whether it’s a beacon or a geofence. ",

      "body": "In the days before the internet, local marketing was simple. You paid for a listing in your local Yellow Pages, printed flyers, and maybe took out an ad in the local paper. People knew who you were and where you were. \n\nThen web marketing came along and changed everything. At first, the recommendation was to focus on general keywords. But over the years, Google and other search engines have changed their algorithms. Now, they prioritize local search over everything else. \n\nWhat does that mean? In short, it means that creating compelling local content isn’t optional. It’s as necessary as oxygen. You’ve got to show potential customers that you’re part of a community – and that means that you’ve got to think about more than giving out your address. \n\nThe Basics of Local Marketing \n\nI’ve already written a lot about local marketing, but I think it’s important to include a summary of how to optimize your website and content for local search. Keep these pointers in mind: \n\nChoose local keywords that are highly relevant to your business and have a high search volume. The best local search words include the name of your city, state or neighborhood as well as keywords that are relevant to your business. \n\nOptimize for local voice search and “near me” searches. \n\nOptimize for mobile search and make sure your site looks great on mobile devices. \n\nUse your local keywords in important places on your website, including in title tags, image tags, meta descriptions, anchor text for links, H1 tags, and in your content. \n\nUse rich snippets to add essential geographical information to your Google search results. \n\nGet important local sites to link back to your site. Remember, when it comes to building links, quality is more important than quantity. Focus on local business guides, the Chamber of Commerce, and related local businesses to build your local SEO “cred.” \n\nEncourage your customers to leave reviews and link your site to your review pages. Customer testimonials, which go into a bit more depth than reviews, are also essential. \n\nFollowing these tips will set you up for success – but you’ve still got to create the kind of compelling local content that will attract customers. \n\nTips for Creating Local Content \n\nOnce your site is optimized for local searches, it’s time to focus on creating local content. That means more than simply putting your local keywords into general content. You’ll need to show casual visitors to your site that you’re a part of a local community. \n\nHere are some pointers to get you started. \n\n1. Blog about local events. Every community, from small rural towns to huge cities, has local events that are a big deal. As a business owner, you should be aware of these events and find a way to write about them that ties back to your business. It’ll be easy if you’re planning to sponsor a booth at your local street fair. But local charity events and holiday celebrations offer the opportunity for you to talk about your community and why you love it. \n\n2. Talk about local news. Did your local Little League team make the playoffs? Did a high school student win a contest? Is there a new business coming to town? Any of these things could be turned into blog posts and they’re especially effective if you can find an organic way to relate the story to your business. \n\n3. Develop case studies that are relevant to local prospects. You might serve a variety of neighborhoods or more than one town in your area. If that’s the case, it’s your job to show that you care about all the places in your service area. One way to do it is to develop case studies that demonstrate your knowledge of the area and of any special circumstances that might be unique to where you are. For example, a landscaper in Southern California might talk about the risk of wildfires or offer tips on how to get rid of black widow spiders. \n\n4. Find out what your audience is interested in and then write about it. Of course, you don’t want to stray too far from your business, but there’s nothing wrong with getting excited about the things your audience cares about. For example, you might write about an upcoming holiday or the year’s first big storm. \n\nA good way to get ideas for your local content is to stay plugged in to your community online. You might follow you local Chamber of Commerce on Facebook, subscribe to your local paper, and stop into the library to see what new flyers have been added to the bulletin board. \n\nWhat Is the Intent of Your Content? \n\nOne of the most important things to remember when you’re creating local content is that every blog post or social media update you write should have a clear intention that’s related to your business. \n\nWhat do I mean by that? Simply that you can’t waste time blogging about things if you don’t understand why you’re writing about them. Sometimes the intent will be clear. You own a hardware store and blogging about predicted winter snowfall might help you sell some shovels and snowblowers, or at least some Ice Melt. \n\nAt other times, though, the intention may be a bit harder to pin down. There’s nothing wrong with that but make sure you don’t skip this step. If you’re creative enough, you should be able to find a way to tie any piece of content you create back to your business. \n\nFor example, say you want to blog about a local charity event, but you can’t figure out a way to connect it to your business organically. Instead of giving up, you might consider donating a portion of your sales to the charity or collaborating with other local business owners on a fundraising effort. \n\nThe key here is to make your local content relevant to your business and to your target audience. You can still share general content, too, but local content is a must if you want your business to grow. ",

      "body": "Before automation was possible, people had to do everything by hand. It took a long time – and once we realized that we could automate repetitive tasks, we never looked back. \n\nSo, the question I have for you about automating your business is a simple one: \n\nWhat are you waiting for? \n\nThe numbers don’t lie. Here’s what we know about automation: \n\n60% of all occupations could save 30% of their time with automation \n\nIt’s estimated that the average CEO spends 20% of their time on tasks that could be automated \n\nBusinesses lose an estimated 20% to 30% of their profits due to inefficient processes \n\nYou can see that there’s time (and money) to be saved with automation. Here are 8 ways to power your business with automation – and boost your bottom line. \n\n#1: Marketing Emails \n\nThis one’s obvious, but I’m always shocked at how many small businesses don’t have an active email list. Since one of the biggest excuses business owners make is a lack of time – and believe me, I get it – there’s no excuse not to embrace email automation. \n\nThe beauty of email automation is that it’s truly a “set it and forget it” proposition when it comes to new subscribers. Unless you make major changes in your business, your introductory email sequence will work for years. And adding new emails is a snap. \n\n#2: Lead Nurturing \n\nLead nurturing only works if it’s consistent. You can easily use automation to streamline your lead nurturing process and ensure that nobody falls through the cracks. \n\nFor example, automation can: \n\nRemind you to make phone calls \n\nMake a record of your outgoing phone calls \n\nSend automated emails to follow up on voice mails \n\nYou’re busy and you might miss something if you try to handle your lead nurturing without automation. With the right tools, you can automate most of the process and turn more of your leads into paying customers. \n\n#3: Repeat Sales \n\nIf you have customers who order from you regularly, it’s essential to stay on top of those orders and send reminders as needed. One of the beauties of automation is that you can use it to set reminders and send your clients prompts to place their regular order. \n\nAutomation can also be useful for other parts of repeat sales, including creating invoices and sending collection reminders. These things will ensure that you most loyal customers know you care about them and value their business. \n\nOn a related note, you can use automation to remind customers when they abandon items in their shopping cart. \n\n#4: Client Appreciation \n\nOnce you attract a new client, it’s important to let them know that you value their business. But as you know, it’s all too easy to get distracted in the course of a busy day and forget to touch base with your existing clients. \n\nWith automation, you can create a welcome series of emails to ensure that new clients feel appreciated and valued. You can also set reminders to follow up regularly, thus minimizing the risk of losing a client because they think you’ve forgotten about them. You can even use automation to remind you of clients’ birthdays, so you can send them a card or email wishing them a happy birthday. \n\n#5: Customer Support \n\nWe live in a service economy and that means that customer service is hugely important when it comes to attracting and retaining customers. Automation can help you do the best possible job of serving your customers and giving them what they need. \n\nFor example, setting up a customer service chatbot is easier than ever before. Chatbots can handle simple customer service requests such as password resets and address changes. They can also, if programmed properly, make product suggestions and redirect customers to self-service options when it’s appropriate. \n\n#6: Scheduling \n\nScheduling (and remembering) appointments can be a real hassle when you’re busy – and most business owners are! Automation can help you by automatically adding events and appointments to your calendar. Then, it can send you reminders before your appointments. \n\nThe same is true of appointments with clients. You can use automation to schedule the meeting and then, use it before the meeting to confirm the appointment and minimize the chances that anybody will forget to show up. \n\n#7: Collect Customer Data \n\nCollecting information about your customers can help you do a variety of important things, including: \n\nCreate a content marketing strategy that provides them with the answers they want \n\nAddress problems with your existing products and services \n\nTarget your marketing and advertising to the people who are most likely to buy from you \n\nLearn how to improve your customer service \n\nAutomated surveys, which you can send out via email or link to on social media, are a good way to get data from your customers. With automation, you can tally the results and analyze them – leaving you free to focus on what to do with the information you collect. \n\n#8: Build a Referral Database \n\nReferral business is valuable because the leads you get from referrals are likely to be highly targeted and relevant to your business. It’s a must to build a referral database that allows you to track your referral sources and make good on any incentives you’re offering to encourage referrals. \n\nFor example, you can assign referral codes for online referrals and track them as you receive calls or emails. Then, you can use automation to thank your referral sources and in your lead nurturing as well. You can also automate the referral process by making it simple for your existing clients or local business partners to direct potential customers to your website. \n\nAutomation is here to stay – there’s no question about that. The question is what will you do with it? While there are many potential answers, I think the 8 suggestions here are the best ways to use automation to your advantage, attract new clients, and make your business both efficient and profitable.

      "body": "Blogging is still one of the best ways to drive traffic to your website and attract new customers. But are you making the most of your local business blog? Maybe not. \n\nIf you’re not, the big question is what should you be doing? The answer starts with numbers and ends with specific advice. So, let’s dig into some statistics, and then we’ll look at 5 tips you can use to put your blog to work for you. \n\nBlogging by the Numbers \n\nA massive study of blogging, which reviewed 912 million blog posts, revealed some helpful information that can help you improve the performance of your business blog. Here are some of its key findings. \n\nBacklinks \n\nBacklinks are still one of the most important ranking factors for Google. The blogging study found that long-form content gets 77.2% more links than short-form content. That’s a huge difference, but it also has its limits. \n\nThe study also found that there was a sharp drop-off in links once a post crept over 2,000 words. But, that said, 94% of all the posts analyzed had no backlinks at all. \n\nIt’s also worth noting that some post formats and titles get more backlinks than others. The three most popular post types for backlinks were: \n\n“What” posts \n\n“Why” posts \n\nInfographics \n\nThose three formats got 25.8% more backlinks than “how-to” and video posts. \n\nSocial Sharing \n\nYou might think that blogging can help you out on social media, but the numbers don’t bear that out. For example, there’s no correlation between social sharing and backlinks. \n\nIt’s also interesting to note that very few blog posts perform well on social media. The study found that 1.3% of “power” posts generate 75% of all social shares. \n\nThere were some specific findings about the length of headlines (longer headlines get more shares) and questions (blog posts with questions in the headline get more shares than those without questions.) \n\nList posts are more likely to be shared than other posts, too – and by a significant amount. They get 218% more shares than “how-to” posts and 203% more shares than infographics. \n\nThe so-called ‘sweet spot” for getting your blog content shared on social media is between 1,000 and 2,000 words. \n\nOne final statistic to inspire you: one study found that blogging can improve your chances of getting a high rank on Google by as much as 434%. How’s that for an impressive number? \n\nTips to Improve Your Local Business Blog \n\nThe data from that study is useful because it can provide you with a framework to improve your business blog. Of course, there’s more to worry about than backlinks and social media, but other bits of data from the study point in a direction that may be useful. \n\nWith that in mind, here are 5 tips to improve your blog. \n\n#1: Create (and Stick to) a Blogging Schedule \n\nThe first tip is to blog regularly and stick to a schedule. There’s some evidence to suggest that blogging four times a week is optimal. In fact, companies that blog at least 16 times per month get 3.5 times as much traffic as companies that blog between 0 and 4 times per month. \n\n16 blog posts might seem like a lot. But what you may find is that creating a blogging schedule will help you be more disciplined about coming up with blog ideas and getting those posts written. And remember, you can always hire a writer to create blog posts for you if you don’t have the time or inclination to do that much writing. \n\n#2: Give Your Posts Compelling Titles \n\nIt turns out that titles make a big difference when it comes to generating traffic, social shares, and backlinks. Here are some pointers: \n\nList posts tend to perform better than other types of content on social media. That’s part of the reason that sites like Buzzfeed have so many lists. People like them and you can use that knowledge to grab more traffic for your site. \n\nGive your posts long-ish titles. One study found that blog posts with titles that had between 6 and 13 words performed the best. \n\nAsk a question. That big blogging study found that blog titles that asked questions got 23.3% more social shares than posts without a question. \n\nBe provocative. Saying something that’s surprising or controversial can get people to click even if they’re not inclined to read blog posts. There’s a reason they say that curiosity killed the cat! \n\nA rose by any other name might smell as sweet, but when it comes to blogging, names matter! Need ideas? Check out HubSpot’s blog topic generator or Inbound Now’s idea generator. \n\n#3: Check Your Word Count \n\nEarlier, we mentioned that the “sweet spot” for blog length is between 1,000 and 2,000 words, with longer posts getting more engagement, backlinks, and sharing than shorter posts. \n\nDoes that mean every post you write must be long? Of course not! But, if you’re in the habit of cranking out 300-500 word blog posts, it can help you to write a long post occasionally. It might turn into one of those so-called power posts that generates traffic on social media and Google. \n\n#4: Add Compelling Images \n\nThis might seem like a no-brainer, but it’s surprising how many businesses don’t bother adding images to their blog posts. There’s research that shows that people retain far more information when it’s presented with a visual aid than they do without visuals. \n\nPRO TIP: Pixabay.com and Pexels.com are both great no cost options \n\n#5: Add Social Sharing Buttons and Widgets \n\nPeople are far more likely to share your blog posts if you make it easy for them to do it. That’s why it’s a good idea to add social sharing buttons to your posts. \n\nBe smart about it, though. If you offer a full menu of social sharing buttons, you may find that it has the opposite effect to the one you want. Where’s your social media audience? If they’re mostly on Twitter, put a Twitter button and use the “Tweet this” widget to allow people to share key quotes from your blog. If you’re marketing business-to-business, put a LinkedIn button on your blog. \n\nThe good news here is that it’s not hard to improve your business blog. It’s mostly about being aware of what the numbers say and figuring out a blogging schedule and strategy that’ll work for you. If you do that, the clicks, shares, and links will follow. ",

      "body": "When it comes to getting your brand out there, growing your visibility, and establishing a reputation within your industry, then press releases can be a vital part of your marketing strategy. Aside from having newsworthy events to write about, presenting them as well as possible can make a big impact on your chances of getting published and getting shared. \n\nHere, we’re going to look at some vital tips on how to make sure that your press releases are landing in the right way. From how you write them to how you format and organize them, the tips below will help ensure that they’re more likely to get the attention that you need. \n\nMake Your Angle Easy to Follow \n\nAll too often will businesses try to send a press release for the sake of sending a press release. It’s an effective marketing tool, but only when you actually have some news to share. Start with your angle, decide if it’s truly newsworthy (such as a launch, a new business development, or the like) and write a strong headline that’s based entirely on that angle. It can help you stick to the most important information as you’re writing the rest of the release out. \n\nKeep Building a Contact List \n\nThe first thing you should do is make sure that you’re sending your press releases to the right people. If you’re working with a PR company, it’s likely they will do this for you. However, if you’re doing it alone, whether you’re trying to market in the local area or to an industry-specific audience, you need to start by taking the time to find which contacts you should be sending any press releases to and saving their credentials. Be sure to use email marketing tools that allow you to see which emails bounce back so you can update old contacts as you go on, as well. \n\nCheck for the Obvious Errors \n\nAnyone who writes for a living will tell you that typos and other errors never go away. You should hopefully see less of them as you go along but even when double-checking and reading through your work, it’s all too easy for them to slip through the gap. To that end, it’s a good idea to have an editor where possible. Where that’s not possible, however, then you should use grammar checking apps that can at least highlight the majority of issues to you and really take the time to read over your pieces carefully before sending. \n\nMake It Easy to Share \n\nWhen you’re working on a press release, you want to make sure that it’s very easy for your team to check on it and to offer their feedback. Whether it’s an editor or a member of the marketing department who needs to make sure you’re using the right language and tone for the business, rarely will you work on a press release alone. To that end, document linking software can be very useful in helping multiple people collaborate over a project in no time at all. You don’t want to be emailing multiple versions around, making it easy to get confused. One version, stored, shared, and edited online is usually the best strategy. \n\nMake It Fit Your Style \n\nYou’re going to develop a house style for all manner of communication, including your press releases. Using document format automation software can help you quickly ensure that your press releases are fitted with your logo, your contact information, and any other vital information that is shared across all releases. Furthermore, it makes sure you can quickly sharpen up any piece and get it out the gate rather than having to take the time to do it by hand. \n\nDon’t Make It Too Long – or Too Short \n\nPress releases should present their information as matter-of-factly and snappily as possible. As such, though the word length is variable, you rarely want to go much longer than 600 words, whereas going shorter than 400 can deprive it of marketable value. Similarly, you don’t want the press release summary at the top or the title to be too long either. If paragraphs are getting much longer than 100 words, it’s time to start chopping things down. You can use readability checkers to make sure everything is snappy enough, too. \n\nPress releases are more than a purely written means of marketing. They’re also about how effectively you can present information visually, and how professional you can make your business look at the same time. Hopefully, the tips above help you do just that. ",

This is the battle that marketers are fighting. \n\nWith these hacks, you can increase the number of leads coming in, leaving you to concentrate on the conversions. \n\nUse Pop-Ups Intelligently \n\nA well-placed pop-up, shown at the right time will give website visitors the ideal place to give you their information, which is the Holy Grail for digital advertising and marketers. \n\nUse pop-ups carefully, too soon and you risk annoying people, too late and they may not see a reason to complete their data. \n\nTest your plugin thoroughly to ensure that it’s optimized for mobile. There’s nothing more annoying when you’re viewing a site on mobile than a huge pop-up popping up on the screen, forcing you to try and scroll to find the close button. Most people will just navigate away from the site. \n\nOffer Good Content for Free – But Gate Your Best Content \n\nPeople now expect to find information on the internet for free, but your best content should be behind a data collection form. This can be a worksheet, whitepaper or infographic. \n\nAdd Value with a Giveaway \n\nPeople love a giveaway. There are areas of the internet devoted to the promotion of giveaways and competition. \n\nUsing a platform like Gleam or KingSumo can encourage your audience to interact with your social media channels and website in order to enter the competition. \n\nYou then have people’s details to market to them at a later date. \n\nInvest in Video \n\nVideo is huge, over 75 million people in the US watch at least one video each day. Research by Smart Insights shows that by the end of 2021, the average person will watch 100 minutes of video per day. \n\nPeople love to watch and share videos from social media and email. Video isn’t just a B2C channel, other professionals are looking at case studies and product explainers too. \n\nReach Out to Influencers \n\nInfluencers aren’t just for lifestyle products and Instagram posts. Many people trust the recommendations of thought leaders in their industry. Working with influencers is a great way to piggyback on their popularity. \n\nIf you’re not sure about what influencers are relevant to your industry by joining forums, Facebook and LinkedIn groups and see what people are talking about and sharing. Once you know who you are targeting, you can begin to build credibility with them before approaching them to work with you on a campaign. \n\nGo Where the Data Takes You \n\nThe core of digital marketing is the ability to track it in minute detail. It allows you to precisely record ROI and refines campaigns on the fly. \n\nEnsure that you are tracking all aspects of your digital marketing campaigns form Google Analytics to social media and video marketing statistics. Don’t be afraid to pivot if the data is telling you something isn’t working. \n\nIf you’re not tracking data, you need to start doing so immediately to get the very best results and return for your money.

      "body": "Improving your website’s traffic is something that, as a business, is an essential thing to work on all the time. The more you can build up your traffic, the more opportunities you have of turning in those potential leads to sales. Whether you’re selling a service or product, every effort you can make to help boost your website’s traffic, the better. Here are ten marketing tips to improve your website traffic. \n\nUpgrade or Refresh Your Web Design \n\nYour website design is one that can very quickly go out of style or needs an update. This is due to the fact that the browsers we use will often upgrade their own systems to make them more modern and so everyone else follows suit. The website design that you made several years ago might not work as well anymore and could be in need of a refresh or an upgrade. Take a look at your website and try to see it from the eyes of a customer or stranger that’s seeing it from the first time. What would you pinpoint as being the weak areas of the web design? Is it easy to navigate, or are you having a hard time to feel engaged in the content you’re reading due to the lack of creativity in design? There are lots of things that might be missing, and so it’s worth looking at hiring someone who can design your company one from scratch. \n\nBy having one designed and custom-made, it ends up being unique to your website, and you can have peace of mind that it’s not going to look the same as one of your competitors, for example. \n\nTry to Improve Your SEO \n\nSearch Engine Optimization is something you’ll want to get yourself familiar with if you haven’t already. It can be a great way of helping to boost your website traffic and to get your company’s website, ranking high on the search engines. The higher you are, the more likely you are going to get an increase in views. There are a lot of basic SEO practices that you can teach to your staff and are pretty much understandable for anyone who knows their way around technology. However, for the more complex areas, you might want to look into marketing services and to see what’s available in that regard. With search engine optimization, it’s something that is constantly changed, and in order to keep your company website relevant, you need to be willing to have someone working on it regularly. It might not be something you need full-time and so outsourcing your services to marketing companies can be useful. \n\nLearn More about Your Audience with Data \n\nThe best thing that has come from the internet and through social media is data analysis. In traditional formats, the data you’d gather from your customers would be limited. However, as many people are now on the internet and have a digital footprint, you can definitely gather a lot more information on your audience than ever before. That information can be really helpful when it comes to using the right methods to improve your website traffic. It can influence what type of content or style of content you choose to best suit the age or demographic of your audience. It can alter everything from your tone of voice as a brand and how you market yourself in general online. \n\nUse free platforms like Google Analytics to gain a better understanding of your audience and social media handles too. Social media platforms have free data analysis that is worth looking at in more detail where you can. \n\nWrite Clickable Content \n\nImage Source \n\nContent is a powerful thing, and the more content you can provide online that’s either through your website, social media or via other channels is essential. For your website, you want to look at your layout and consider whether you need to add more to it. Perhaps your information pages where you describe the company are looking a little bland and need a bit of visual content for your viewers to enjoy. \n\nWhen you’re creating content, you want it to be clickable, so think about the language you use and the images you attach with it. Visual content can be really helpful in pulling the viewer in and getting them engaged in it. \n\nExpand Your Reach on Social Media \n\nWhen it comes to marketing, it’s important to expand your reach in different ways, and beyond your website, social media can definitely be useful. Think about how you could use your website to expand your reach on social media. Simply connecting your website to your handles can be useful, but you also might want to ensure all the content you create on your website is also being promoted on your social media handles. It means that you’re going to get more footfall from different places, rather than just organic searches that come from the search engines. \n\nIt’s a good idea to look at what your competitors are doing online when it comes to social media too. You might be able to draw some inspiration from the \n\nGuest Post on Other Websites \n\nPosting content on your own website is important, but it’s also necessary to try and get backlinks onto other sites. These are links to relevant pages of your website that are put on to other high-ranking or influential websites. The more you can do this, the more it will show to the search engines that your website is of value. It’s definitely something you want to be doing where possible. If you can, start looking at what other websites exist out there, and that might have some relevance to your website. You can either create the content in-house or get a marketing team to help out through outsourcing. When guest posting, make sure you are creating a lot of high-quality pieces so that they perform well and hopefully get promoted through other avenues. \n\nBuild Your Newsletter Subscribers \n\nSubscribers on your newsletter are a great influence for building website traffic. They can also be great for when you’re trying to convert leads into potential customers. If you’ve not got an option on your website, which gives your users the opportunity to sign up to your newsletter, then it’s important to do so. You could be missing out on a lot of opportunities by not having a newsletter for those interested in being reminded of whenever you post something new or have some great news that’s worth telling your followers. \n\nStart looking at how you can build your newsletter and to entice people to hand over their emails. It can be great for improving that connection and relationship with your followers too. \n\nRecycle Evergreen Content \n\nImage Source \n\nRecycling evergreen content is something that is referred to as high-performing content and is still relevant. It’s worth reusing any content that’s done well in the past and re-publish it. It can help to build traffic on those particular posts and to also influence your website’s reputation on the internet. \n\nThe more of this content you can have on your website, the better. Look at what is doing well on the internet and use that as a way to create more evergreen content on your website. \n\nCreate A Blog \n\nA blog can be a very useful part of your website. Writing articles that are relevant to your business, and that can help your customers understand you as a brand more is critical to your success. It also builds the traffic on your website because they’ll spend more time on your website to look at the content as a result. If you’ve got the resources within your company to create weekly or daily content, then it’s worth doing. You can end up being an expert in your industry by having content that gets read and engaged by others within your industry. \n\nWhen posting on a blog, be consistent so that your readers know when the next post will be up. It creates a following! \n\nUse Online Advertising \n\nOnline advertising has become one of the most beneficial forms of advertising in comparison to more traditional formats. Online paid advertisements are also a lot more affordable too, so it means more businesses can take advantage of the wider reach you can get from it. When doing paid advertising, make sure you know your audience well and that your campaigns are targeted to these audiences. It might take some time to get it right and to do it via the right platforms, but they can certainly help to improve the amount of traffic that flows to your website. Trial and error the process and expect for some campaigns to not do as well as others might. It’s all about getting the audience right and also the timing of the campaign too. \n\nMarketing your website to improve its traffic is something to always maintain. Find new ways of helping to increase your traffic, whether it’s through your website’s look or what content you’re putting out into the online world. ",

      "body": "It wasn’t that long ago that the idea of a chatbot would have seemed like the stuff of science fiction, right up there with Daleks or droids. \n\nNot anymore. \n\nIn fact, chatbots are everywhere these days. They’re readily available, highly effective and – believe it or not – not that expensive to create. \n\nThat said, a lot of small business owners aren’t on board with them yet because they don’t understand how they work to improve marketing and attract new business. \n\nBy the time you’re done reading this article, you won’t be able to use lack of knowledge as an excuse anymore. Get ready to learn everything you need to know about how chatbot marketing works. \n\nWhat Is a Chatbot? \n\nChatbot is short for chatterbot. A chatbot is a computer program and a form of Artificial Intelligence. It uses something called Natural Language Processing (NLP) to simulate human speech. \n\nWhen programmed properly, a chatbot can interact with customers on your website, on social media, or via a messaging app such as Messenger, WhatsApp, Slack, or Kik. \n\nIf you’re like a lot of small business owners, you might hear ‘artificial intelligence’ and default to thinking that it’s going to be hugely expensive and time-consuming to incorporate AI or a chatbot into your marketing. As you’ll see, that’s not the case. \n\nHow Does Natural Language Processing Work? \n\nI want to say more about NLP because it’s a big part of what makes chatbots work. I’m not a programmer or an AI expert, but here are some things you should know. \n\nNatural Language Processing is what allows a user to type a question into a chatbot and get a relevant and useful response. In other words, it allows the chatbot to interpret the question correctly even if it is not worded in a way that’s standard or grammatically correct. \n\nAs human beings, we have built-in NLP. If someone talks to us and misuses a vocabulary word or uses an incorrect verb form, we can still understand them in most cases. That’s because our brains auto-correct the mistakes they made and tell us the intention behind their words. \n\nNLP allows chatbots to understand conversational intent. It knows what a customer wants to ask even if the customer doesn’t word it in an expected way. \n\nIf you want an idea of how NLP works, pay attention the next time you use a virtual assistant such as Alexa, Siri, Cortana, or Google Voice. You’ve probably noticed that these assistants can grasp your meaning even if you misspeak or stumble over your words. That’s because they use NLP to get at the meaning behind your words. \n\nPretty cool, right? \n\nWhat Are the Benefits of Chatbot Marketing? \n\nNow that you have a basic understanding of how chatbots work, let’s talk about their applications in marketing. Chatbot use was already on the rise, but the COVID-19 pandemic has made their benefits more apparent than they were before. \n\nUsing chatbots in your marketing can help you: \n\nProvide around-the-clock customer support and service – chatbots are always ready to help \n\nRedirect customers to self-service options and make their experience more enjoyableTriage incoming customer service requests to flag the ones that need your attention \n\nSpeed up your service and reduce waiting times for customers \n\nMove people through your sales funnel quickly \n\nSuggest products and services for potential customers to try \n\nWhat I hope you can see from this list is that chatbots, when used properly, can speed up the process of turning a visitor to your website or social media page and turning them into a lead, and then into a paying customer. \n\nBy collecting information to qualify leads, they can allow you to focus your attention on the people who are most likely to buy from you. And, if you own a retail business where lead nurturing isn’t a big concern, they can direct customers to the products they’re most likely to buy. \n\nIn other words, chatbots provide in-the-moment interaction at an affordable price. \n\nHow Much Does It Cost to Build a Chatbot? \n\nWhen I talk to small business owners about chatbot technology, their most common objection is price. The perception of anything related to artificial intelligence is that it will be both expensive and complicated. Let’s get the cost part out of the way. \n\nIf all you want is a simple chatbot to handle basic customer interactions, you can use a chatbot builder and create one for very little money. Examples of builders include: \n\nMobileMonkey \n\nTARS \n\nQuiq \n\nFlow XO \n\nBotsify \n\nSome of these builders, such as Flow XO, offer free trials or even free versions. Opting for one of them will limit your programming choices, but it’s a good way to familiarize yourself with bots and get a first-hand look at how they can help your business. \n\nEven if you opt for a paid subscription, you can build a simple chatbot for under $1,000. Of course, some businesses spend far more than that for custom chatbots, but you don’t need to do that to reap the benefits of chatbot marketing. \n\nIsn’t Building a Chatbot Complicated? \n\nThe second main objection to chatbot marketing is that building a chatbot is complicated. As you’ve probably guessed, using one of the chatbot builders I’ve listed above takes the guesswork out of chatbot programming. \n\nIf you were to try to build a chatbot from scratch, there’s no question that you would need experience with both computer programming and AI. It’s not a job for amateurs. But using one of the builders, most of which use simple drag-and-drop technology, makes it as easy as starting a free blog or creating a meme. \n\nPlease don’t let fears about the technical aspects of chatbots keep you from using them. Those fears aren’t realistic – and you’ll be missing out on one of the best ways to market your business. \n\nHow to Use Chatbots in Marketing \n\nNow that you have a framework for understanding chatbots, let’s dig into some of the ways that you can use chatbots in marketing. There are layers of technology, starting from basic and going all the way up to include advanced bots. Most small business owners will start with the basics. \n\nAutoresponders \n\nThe first tier of chatbot strategy is so simple that you won’t even need to build a chatbot to use it. On Facebook Messenger, businesses have the option of setting up an autoresponder that will reply to messages instantly, letting customers know that you’ll reply to them as soon as you can. \n\nWhile autoresponders won’t really shorten your lead time or help you convert customers, they can satisfy the need for an instant response, making potential leads feel that you’re paying attention and giving them reassurance that they’ll hear from you soon. \n\nList Notifications \n\nThe next tier of sophistication involves building what amounts to a list and using a messaging app to send notifications to people who have messaged you in the past. Again, this is a feature you can use on Facebook Messenger without building an actual bot. \n\nThe benefit of sending notifications is that it’s a quick way to get the word out when you have a new product to launch or you’re running a promotion. The downside is that, for now, you’ll need a minimum of 1,000 people to use this feature on Facebook. \n\nSales Funnel Strategy \n\nEarlier, I mentioned that chatbots can be used to shorten the time it takes people to move through your sales funnel. There are two different options to consider: \n\n1. A basic funnel strategy which amounts to a slightly-more-involved version of autoresponders. To use this strategy, you can send automated messages to recipients and ask them to respond to questions. \n\n2. A contextual funnel strategy which uses NLP to respond to questions and direct leads to products and resources. \n\nYou can decide which option to choose. Both can be worthwhile depending on your needs. For a business where lead nurturing can be minimal, the former is probably enough to get you started. If lead nurturing tends to take a long time, you may benefit more from a contextual strategy that allows for natural interaction throughout the nurturing process. \n\nThe AI-Powered Marketing Strategy \n\nNow it’s time to go beyond the basics. A marketing strategy that’s powered by AI might include: \n\nAutomated customer support \n\nThe handling of repetitive tasks, such as order tracking or password resets \n\nSales suggestions \n\nRedirection to self-service options \n\nIf you want to take it even further, then you can use a tool like DialogFlow, which is a cloud-based software owned by Google. It allows you to “train” your bots. \n\nThe concept of training might sound odd, but here’s what it means. A basic bot searches for keywords and provides a boilerplate response when it recognizes a keyword. For instance, if someone types “Reset password” into your chatbot, the bot knows to walk the person through the password reset process because it’s been programmed to recognize those keywords. \n\nWith the training option, chatbots can interpret language using NLP. Over time, the machine teaches itself using something called machine learning. It picks up clues from context and gradually learns how to interpret and understand language even when it doesn’t match the keywords it’s been programmed to understand. \n\nThis type of marketing strategy allows bots to nurture leads in a way that feels natural and intentional. Instead of answering multiple choice questions, the chatbot can ask and respond to questions in a conversational manner. \n\nOmnichannel Chatbot Strategy \n\nThe top tier of chatbot marketing involves omnichannel marketing, where you integrate your marketing and chatbots across all platforms, ensuring that your customers will have a seamless experience wherever they engage with you and your company. \n\nThat might mean taking the people from your Messenger list and exporting them to a list that you use for email or a text notification list. Keep in mind that you’ll need to get permission to add people to those lists. You’ll also need to let them know if you’re collecting and saving data from their chats. \n\nWithin Facebook Messenger, you can ask people for information that you need to add them to other lists, including their mobile number or email address. \n\nOther potential integrations include mobile pay options such as GooglePay or Apple Wallet. Today’s consumers are comfortable with mobile technology and may prefer to pay you with these tools. They offer encryption that protects users from identity theft. \n\nGetting Started \n\nIf you’re convinced and you want to give chatbots a try, here are my suggestions: \n\n1. Try a free chatbot builder to get your feet wet. \n\n2. Start with simple, automated responses. \n\n3. Let your customers know that your chatbot is there for them to try. \n\n4. Solicit feedback about your chatbot. \n\n5. Refine your offerings as needed. \n\n6. Step up your chatbot to include NLP and machine learning. \n\n7. Integrate your chatbot across multiple platforms and channels. \n\nThe bottom line is that chatbots are here to stay. Eventually you’re going to need to build one – and you might as well do it know, when getting on board with the technology can give you a leg up on your competitors! \n\nDo you want to learn more about how a chatbot can benefit your business? \n\nClick here to learn more about our Chatbot Marketing Service today!

      "body": "The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the entire world. Business owners have had to scramble to find ways to stay afloat even as they’ve had to work from home and halt in-person sales and services. It’s a lot for anybody to deal with at a time that’s already stressful. \n\nThe solution for most business owners is to find ways to offer more value to customers to keep them on board and ensure they’ll stick with your company in the long run. \n\nThat sounds great, but what’s the best way to do it? As you might suspect, the answer’s both easy and complicated. \n\nThe Pandemic by the Numbers \n\nLet’s start with some statistics that help to paint a picture of what your customers might need during this difficult time. \n\nRecord numbers of Americans have filed for unemployment benefits, meaning that many are living with financial uncertainty and stress. Over 6 million people filed in the week ending March 28th. \n\nBetween 1.4 and 2.1 million small businesses are at risk of closing their doors permanently. \n\nMore than 75% of consumers have experimented with new buying behavior during the pandemic, including a shift to online and digital buying and a decrease in brand loyalty. \n\nThe only category of spending to experience growth is things people consider to be essential – in other words, impulse buying is down. \n\nThe takeaway here is that the pandemic has made a significant impact on both consumer confidence and consumer spending. If you want your customers to continue buying from you, you must give them a reason to do so. \n\nFocus on What Your Customers Are Feeling \n\nThe first thing you’ll need to do is to make sure that your customers know you understand what they’re feeling. Some of the most common emotions right now are: \n\nFear \n\nUncertainty \n\nSadness \n\nDoubt \n\nIn the marketing world, you probably know about FUD – fear, uncertainty and doubt. In normal times, there’s a tendency for marketers to try to create a sense of uncertainty or fear, such as FOMO, the fear of missing out. \n\nThat’s not a good idea during the pandemic because people are already feeling those things. You don’t need to do anything to incite those emotions. Instead, your job is to empathize with them. Consumers are far more likely to buy from a company that understands them than with a company that only seems to be out to make money. \n\nCommunicate Your Empathy Effectively \n\nUnderstanding your customers is one thing, but it won’t matter if you can’t effectively communicate your empathy. That means focusing on clear, compassionate communication that reassures your target audience. \n\nWhat does that look like? Here are some possibilities: \n\nPutting a COVID-19 statement on your website and making it apparent what you’re doing to keep your customers safe. Examples may include social distancing markers and procedures, escalated cleaning, and shipping precautions. \n\nSending an email series addressing your customers’ concerns and detailing how you can help. \n\nEngaging more frequently on social media and encouraging your audience to share their thoughts and feelings with you. \n\nThe focus should be on letting your customers know that you’re there to help. If they know that, they’ll be more likely to buy from you even if they’re not buying from other businesses. \n\nOffer Increased Value \n\nSince consumers are mostly spending only on essentials, it’s your job to offer as much value as possible to your customers to encourage them to buy from you. Small business owners are getting creative. Here are some of the things I’ve noticed: \n\nAn increase in online ordering options, including expanded ordering, delivery, and payment options. \n\nAddition of new product and service options, including things like delivery, curbside pickup and by-appointment in-person services. \n\nCreation of new products and bundles designed to meet the needs of people as they quarantine and work from home. \n\nIt’s no accident that many apparel companies, for example, have started to manufacture and sell masks. There’s a huge need for them and a natural desire for people to get masks they like. Selling products and services that meet the immediate needs of your customers is a good way to stay relevant. \n\nRefocus Your Marketing on Digital \n\nYour marketing focus during the pandemic should be fine-tuned to reflect the needs and wants of your customers. For many small businesses, that means doubling down on digital spending and solutions. \n\nYour customers may need: \n\nAdditional online ordering and delivery options \n\nAdditional payment options \n\nIncreased communication on social media \n\nMore emails offering them immediate value and solutions to their problems \n\nYou may also want to consider allowing customers to sign up for text updates in addition to email. \n\nRevamp Your Budget \n\nFinally, you should take a close look at your budget – both for marketing and operations – and reallocate your resources accordingly. \n\nFor example, if you have applied for and received a PPP loan to cover your payroll, you may be able to put some extra money into marketing. Search engine marketing and social media marketing are both useful right now as people hunker down at home and spend more time online. \n\nIf you’ve had to lay off employees or downsize your office, you may have money in the budget that can be repurposed. Or you may need to cut across the board. Either way, it’s a good idea to review your marketing mix and figure out what’s going to work for you in the short term. \n\nIt’s also worth noting that the reallocation process should include testing. It may take some trial and error to arrive at the most effective marketing mix. It’s useful to view your budget as a fluid thing and be willing to reallocate funds as needed. \n\nThe bottom line? \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused a lot of stress for small business owners, but it also represents an opportunity to realign your business with your customers’ needs. Your willingness to meet the challenges head-on can help you to solidify your brand, ensure customer loyalty, and protect your business in the long term. ",

      "body": "What do you do when business is slow, and profits are down? \n\nIf you think that the answer is “stop marketing,” then it’s time to think again. While it’s true that marketing might seem to be less essential than other areas of business, the truth is that a solid marketing plan could spell the difference between success and failure. \n\nNot convinced? \n\nIt turns out there’s research to support the idea that marketing is critical during a recession. A Harvard Business Review study looked at the performance of 4,500 businesses during recession. It found that the companies with the most forward-thinking attitudes – in other words, those that didn’t engage in drastic cutting of their marketing budgets – performed the best both during the recession and in the long term. \n\nThis evidence doesn’t mean you should go on a spending spree, buying ads left and right. What it does mean is that smart marketing should be your focus. Here are some tips for marketing on a budget. \n\nAudit Your Existing Content \n\nOne of the best ways to market on a budget is to make use of what you already have. Existing content can be updated or repurposed. Here are some tips: \n\nReview your blog posts, videos, graphics and photos to see what may be relevant to your current marketing plan. \n\nMake note of content that would need updating to be used again. \n\nDon’t forget to review your social media posts to find content that can be used again. \n\nOther assets to consider include emails, lead magnets, eBooks, white papers, case studies, infographics, and web pages. \n\nYou may want to set up a spreadsheet to keep track of everything. You can use it to indicate different potential uses for content, too. \n\nBrainstorm New Ways to Use Old Content \n\nOnce you’ve completed your inventory, it’s time to think about what you can do to repurpose your old content and make it relevant to your audience in the here and now. \n\nFor example, you might be able to take an old blog post and revamp it as an infographic; or turn an eBook into a webinar. \n\nKeep in mind that you may need to do some work to make the content reusable. A blog post that uses statistics from three years ago will need updating before it can be turned into a chart or infographic. You don’t want to have outdated data. \n\nConnect with Your Customers \n\nIt can be tricky to determine what kind of content would be useful to your audience in the new reality we’re all experiencing. You might not be able to spend a ton of money on customer research. That said, there’s no reason you can’t reach out to your audience and ask for their input. \n\nOne of my favorite ways to conduct audience research is by creating a survey and sending it out to my email list. Surveys should be short – no more than 5-10 questions at most. Make sure it’s easy to complete. \n\nAnother option is to create a poll or post a question on social media. On Facebook, you can actually create a poll and post it as a status update. For other sites, such as Instagram and Twitter, you may want to pose a question and ask the people who respond to use a hashtag you create for that purpose. \n\nAny information you collect can be used to inform your new marketing strategy. Your focus should be on learning what kind of content your audience wants to see, where they want to see it, and what products and services they’ll find most useful during the pandemic. \n\nFocus on Local SEO \n\nYou’re probably sick of hearing me talk about local SEO, so I’ll keep this section brief. Local SEO is your best bet for pandemic marketing on a budget. \n\nLet’s talk about why. First, consumers are eager to support local businesses in this time of need. They need to know who you are to support you and local SEO is the best way to reach them. \n\nSecond, local businesses can avail themselves of options that national businesses can’t. For example, you can deliver or offer curbside pick-up services. Those things are convenient to customers and can help you attract new business. \n\nFinally, local SEO is, by definition, highly targeted. It lends itself to marketing on a budget because you’ll spend less to reach people in your local audience. \n\nEnough said. \n\nCollect Reviews and Testimonials \n\nOnline reviews have never been more important than they are now. I’ve already quoted the statistics for you in past articles, but here’s why you should be focusing on them now. \n\nAs noted above, customers are actively looking for local businesses to support. They’ll be more likely to take a chance on you if you have recent reviews on sites like Yelp and Google My Business. \n\nIt’s also worth noting that reviews are free, which means they’re an inexpensive way to attract new business. \n\nMy suggestion is to decide how and when to ask customers for reviews and be consistent about it. For example, you might send them an email asking for a review a day or two after they order from you (or within a few days of delivery, if applicable.) \n\nThen, monitor your reviews and respond to all of them, positive and negative. Consumers want to reward businesses that engage with their customers. \n\nCreate a Digital To-Do List \n\nSo far, I’ve focused on short-term strategy; now, let’s talk about something you can do that will help you out in the long term. \n\nI’m willing to bet that there are a lot of things in the marketing arena that you’ve been wanting to do. They might include: \n\nUpdating your website \n\nCreating an online store \n\nSegmenting your email list \n\nStandardizing your social media profiles \n\nFixing broken links \n\nTesting ads and content \n\nGuess what? \n\nThis is the perfect time to tackle some of these projects. Not only will they give you a focus during a time that might otherwise be stressful, they’ll also set you up for success in the future. You can do many of these things without spending a ton of money. \n\nNobody’s a fan of this pandemic, but if you handle your marketing properly now, your business will survive the storm. You may even find that you come out of this time more successful and profitable than ever! ",

      "body": "You want to grow your business. That’s a given. \n\nNew customer acquisition is expensive. Another given. \n\nWhat a business owner to do? If you have an unlimited marketing budget, you can simply put it into attracting and nurturing new customers. But I don’t know many small business owners who have that luxury. \n\nFortunately, there are alternatives. One of the best options is to start a referral program. Here’s how to do it. \n\nWhat Is a Referral Program? \n\nA customer referral program is a program that encourages and incentivizes your existing customers to refer other people to your business. \n\nYou already know that it’s costly to acquire new customers. In fact, as of 2020, it cost about five times as much to acquire a new customer as it does to hold on to an existing customer. \n\nNew customer acquisition is also time-consuming. It takes between 5 and 7 interactions with a brand for people to remember it. \n\nReferral programs are both less expensive and less time-consuming than traditional customer acquisition. One of the biggest reasons is that they come with built in social proof. Research shows that more than 80% consumers trust a personal recommendation from a friend more than they would a review in a newspaper or magazine. \n\nWhat Are the Benefits of Starting a Referral Program? \n\nThe biggest benefit of starting a referral program is that referral programs are proven to work. Here are some statistics that illustrate their potential. \n\n60% of marketers say that customer referrals are an excellent source of leads \n\n54% agree that the per-lead cost of referral programs is lower than other lead channels \n\n78% of B2B marketers like referrals as a way of generating qualified leads \n\nPeople who are referred by a friend are 4 times as likely to make a purchase as people who find your company any other way \n\nReferral programs provide a low-cost, high-reward way to attract new customers to your business. People are already asking your customers for recommendations. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to harness something they’re already doing to make it beneficial for them – and profitable for you. \n\nThe Best Referral Program Ideas for Small Businesses \n\nNow it’s time for the fun part. There are dozens of different ways to set up a referral program and you can get creative with it. The main components you need are: \n\nA fun and appealing name \n\nRules for how the program works \n\nA system of incentives and rewards \n\nA way to let your customers know about the program \n\nOne of the biggest things you’ll need to decide ahead of time is when the rewards kick in. Will you give a customer a reward when they refer someone, or only if that referral turns into something more? It’s important to be specific, so that your customers know what to expect. \n\nTo get an idea of how your referral program can work, let’s look at some examples. \n\nGrubHub \n\nGrubHub is a food delivery app that’s become hugely popular. People can use it to order food from local restaurants and have it delivered to them at home or at work. \n\nGrubHub’s referral program is especially clever because it incentivizes people to order at both ends. When an existing GrubHub customer refers a friend, the friend gets a discount off their first order; AND the person who made the referral gets a discount at the same time. \n\nI know a lot of people who use GrubHub and refer people for exactly this reason. It’s a great program that is set up for success. \n\nDapperTime \n\nDapperTime is a watch company that puts a different spin on the discounting game. Instead of offering a flat discount their referral program works more like an affiliate program. \n\nThe key difference here is that the person who does the referring earns a percentage of their friend’s purchase. That way, if the friend turns into a big spender, the person who referred them will get to share in the rewards. \n\nThis model won’t work for every business, but it’s worth considering if you think it will appeal to your customers. \n\nHubstaff \n\nWhen it comes to B2B referrals, you may need to offer a bit more incentive for your clients to refer other business owners to you. One option is to set up a recurring commission option like Hubstaff did. \n\nParticipants in their referral form get a dedicated link they can use to refer people to Hubstaff. When one of their referrals signs up, they get a 30% commission for life. \n\nLet’s be clear. That’s a big reward and not one every small business can afford to offer. However, because the incentive is so attractive, it’s the kind of thing that will incentivize people to participate because they’ll start spending their commission mentally as soon as they hear about the program. \n\nDropbox \n\nOne of the earliest and most successful digital referral programs is the one created by Dropbox. \n\nInstead of offering participants money back or a commission, they offered what is arguably their most valuable commodity: storage space. For each friend that a customer refers, they get additional storage ranging from 500 MB to 1 GB per referral. That space is theirs for as long they have their Dropbox account. \n\nSoylent \n\nNot all referral programs offer a reward directly to participants. Some, like Soylent’s, give them an opportunity to give their reward to people in need. \n\nThis program gives participants’ friends a discount and donates four meals to a food-related charity. In other words, the reward comes in the form of a good deed. People who join the program do it and have the satisfaction of knowing they’ve helped someone who needs it. \n\nA similar program is the one at PillPack, where each referral that results in a sale gets a $100 donation to a charity that builds healthcare facilities for children. Charity-based referral programs are highly appealing to Millennials, who like to align themselves with companies who share their values. \n\nThese are just a few examples of successful referral programs. My suggestion is that you start with your customers and figure out what’s most likely to appeal to them. Then, you can work backward from there to create a referral program that works for them and you. \n\nTools to Build Your Referral Program \n\nNot sure how to start building your referral program? Here are a few tools that can help you do it with a minimum of time and trouble. \n\nExtole has beautiful templates you can use to sign people up for your referral program, and options to add the rewards you choose. \n\nYotpo offers custom-designed landing pages and pop-ups and a choice of reward structures. \n\nOmnistar Affiliate Software has built-in sign-up forms, promo codes, and free promotional tools to help you advertise your referral program. \n\nTapMango has an array of customizable programs to choose from and offers SMS, mobile push, and email options to manage your referrals. \n\nThese are just a few of the software options available. You can read reviews and compare your options here. \n\nWhat are you waiting for? Starting a referral program now is one of the best ways to secure your future success! ",

      "body": "Video marketing is still the king of the hill when it comes to driving clicks and sales. \n\nThe numbers don’t lie. \n\nAccording to Social Media Today: \n\n72% of consumers prefer to watch a video to learn about a product or service. \n\n78% of consumers watch a video online at least once a week, and 55% do so once a day. \n\nViewers retain 95% of a video’s message after watching it. \n\n93% of business retain a new customer when they post a video on social media. \n\nCompanies that use video in their marketing experience 49% faster growth than companies that don’t use video. \n\nI hope you’re as impressed by these statistics as I am. Since video is easier and more affordable to produce than every before, here are 5 types of video marketing to try to help you grow your business. \n\n1: Product and Service Demo Videos \n\nPeople need to understand how a product or service works – and how it will benefit them – before they buy it. I don’t think I need to explain why because I’m sure you feel that way too. If you don’t grasp a product’s significance or how it can help you, you’re not going to spend your money on it. \n\nFor that reason, demo videos are a cornerstone of any effective video marketing strategy. Product demo videos are straightforward, but here are some things to keep in mind: \n\nIf the product requires assembly, include a demonstration in the video \n\nShow the most common uses for the product \n\nIf there are alternate uses, include those too \n\nConsider adding some instructions about caring for or cleaning the product \n\nIf you sell a service, the rules are a little different. Your video should include: \n\nAn overview of the service \n\nA step by step review of what the service includes \n\nA service walk-through to let potential clients know what they’ll be getting if they sign up \n\nDemo videos should be posted on your website as close to the point of sales as possible. You may also want to put them on a dedicated landing page, your blog, and your social media pages. \n\n2: Testimonial Videos \n\nCustomer reviews are important in every industry, but a testimonial from a client or customer can carry far more weight than an ordinary review. \n\nTestimonials tend to include more detailed information than reviews. They give you a chance to highlight the specific things you did for a client and the specific ways your product benefited them. You can also encourage customers who provide testimonials to talk about their experience with your company, including customer service and tech support. \n\nIn other words, testimonial videos provide potential leads with a detailed look at the customer experience at your company – and they can help to overcome many of the most common buyer objections, so you can make more sales. \n\n3: Brand Story Videos \n\nWhat is your brand’s story? Today’s consumers want to identify with the brands they support. You can help them identify with you by sharing a customer-centric brand story that lets them visualize how you can help them. \n\nIn other words, you’re not telling your origin story so much as you are telling the customer’s journey in an entertaining and compelling way. This kind of marketing has become increasingly popular. \n\nYour job, when creating a brand story video, is to make your customer – that is, the person watching the video – into the hero. To do that, you’ll need to: \n\nIdentify the most common problems you solve \n\nCreate a story arc to show how your product or service solves the problem \n\nEncourage the viewer to see themselves in whatever success story you’re presenting \n\nAnother way to look at this kind of video is as a pre-testimonial – sort of a fictionalized version of what a customer’s life could look like if they buy your product or use your service. \n\n4: Frequently Asked Questions Video \n\nWe all know about FAQ, right? It’s the section on every website where customers’ most common questions are asked and answered. These days, they’re also a great way to improve your SEO since questions and voice search go together like milk and cookies. \n\nFAQ videos don’t need to answer every question at once. Instead, you should consider doing a series of short videos that answer one question or several related ones in an entertaining way. \n\nIf you want to get creative with this type of video, you could do a whiteboard video or even an animated video illustrating the answer to your FAQs. There’s no reason that an informational video can’t be entertaining, too. \n\n5: Personalized Sales Videos \n\nThis last idea won’t work for every business, but it provides a way to hook potential leads Instead of sending a lead a generic, one-size-fits-all video, you can send them something personalized. \n\nPersonalized sales videos should: \n\nAddress the prospect by name. \n\nHighlight the specific ways your product or service can help them. \n\nAdd information that will help the prospect overcome any objections they might have to buying your product or using your service. \n\nKeep in mind that this type of video doesn’t need to have huge production value. It should feel like you or your salesperson is speaking directly to the prospect, giving them valuable information that will help them understand the benefits of doing business with you. \n\nThe message that a personalized sales video sends is that you care deeply about your customers. If you’re willing to shoot a personalized video before a prospect is even a client, it makes them feel that you’ll provide top-notch customer service after they sign on. \n\nVideo marketing isn’t going anywhere. You can produce videos without spending a lot of money, and once you have created a video, it can be posted anywhere you post content online, including your website, blog, and social media pages. \n\nOf course, if you try these methods, you can blend them with cool video technology, such as 360-video, virtual reality, or live video. Your focus should always be on creating the kind of video content that’s most likely to convert leads into paying customers. ",

      "body": "Adaptive marketing is crucial. If you can’t quickly change your approach when it’s not working, you can be throwing money down the drain. Even when it is working, you should still have a plan to switch it up. When you have a good marketing message and a recognizable brand that are performing as they should be, why should you think about how you can change it? For one, there’s no guarantee that this approach will continue to be successful. Audiences, market forces, and new competition can all shake things up. Here are a few ways to make sure you don’t get left behind. \n\nPractice Brand Adaptation \n\nEven if your brand doesn’t have to change its approach with what it is currently doing, you should always be ready to adapt a brand to new circumstances. For instance, take the example of a print media company moving into publishing stories in a new interest group or category, they may want to change their logo to get closer to the material that they are publishing. Establishing a style guide can help you practice the ways that you can adapt the brand, including its story, its voice, and the imagery that it uses. That way, you can see what does and doesn’t work, making sure that good branding stays consistent even when it has to change a little here and there. \n\nUse Analytics Constantly \n\nMost social media and marketing platforms, at least those online, offer easy access to the analytics that report on how well your marketing efforts are going. They can track the clicks, conversions, bounce rates, and much more that can help you get a better idea of what is going right and what is going wrong. By paying attention to them, you can reduce your spending on strategies that aren’t as effective, while focusing on replicating what works elsewhere. If your analytics show a general decline, it’s a good sign that your overall marketing and branding strategy, at the moment, is not as effective as it should be. It can also help you find the “evergreen content” that you can continue to repost, reuse and adapt to different platforms and topics. \n\nHave a Rebrand at the Ready \n\nSometimes, the worst does happen. Perhaps a launch goes terribly and you fail to establish any platform for the business for months and months. Perhaps there is a significant mistake that causes irreparable damage to the reputation of the brand as it stands. Or perhaps you simply want to expand into a new market but your existing branding won’t allow for it due to competition that looks too similar. Rebranding your business is a big step and you don’t want to have to do it on the fly. Ask yourself if you’re ready to make the rebrand and, if not, take the steps to establish a rebrand ahead of time. Putting together a second style guide and a new launch strategy might be wise, for instance. \n\nReevaluate Your Target Audience \n\nAs mentioned, your audience may change over the years. You can start targeting one demographic but then find that you’re not getting the customers that fit those expectations. As such, you should always be looking at your target audience and reevaluating who they are, what they need from your business, what their barriers are, and even how you approach them. Collecting customer information with things like email contact forms can help you get a much better idea of who is actually converting to your business rather than who you assume you should be targeting. \n\nTest New Approaches Continuously \n\nEven if you’re marketing effectively and reaching your targets, there are always improvements to be made. Optimization should be done for its own sake, not only when you’re not doing as well as you want. You can unlock the path to a more cost-effective and impactful marketing strategy. For that reason, practice A/B testing where possible. This involves running smaller trials of things like landing pages, email marketing, and adverts that make both minor and major changes to the ones that you are currently running. You can then compare their results and make permanent adjustments if the new method of marketing seems to work more effectively than the one you are currently using. This should be a continuous process, too, not just a one and done. \n\nMarketing, just like any aspect of running a business, needs to be adaptive to the situation. Always have a plan to change things up or at least know how to get insights on the ways it should be changing. ",

      "body": "Marketing in a time of economic crisis is no joke. But you already know that. \n\nLet’s face it: it’s difficult, at best, to know how to handle your marketing when unemployment numbers are high, spending is low, and uncertainty is everywhere you look. \n\nAnd yet, for all that, marketing is a must if you want your business to stay afloat. \n\nFor your business to survive, it’s a must to come up with a marketing plan that’s: \n\nPractical \n\nAffordable \n\nAchievable \n\nEffective \n\nIf you can’t do that, then you may find yourself struggling. \n\nThe good news is that we’ve done some of the work for you. Here’s your 30-day marketing plan to reopen your business. \n\nWeek 1 – Preparing to Reopen \n\nReopening your business should be guided by recommendations from the CDC and local officials. You may have specific guidelines to follow and safety measures to implement. You should put those in place first before you do anything else. \n\nOnce you’ve selected a reopening date, here’s what you should do in the week before you announce your reopening. \n\n1. Review your competitors’ websites to see how they’re handling reopening – and don’t be afraid to use their ideas in your own marketing! \n\n2. Prepare a written reopening policy and distribute it to employees. \n\n3. Update your website with a statement about COVID-19 if you have not already done so. Make sure to include details about the steps you’ll be taking to make your business space safe for employees and customers. \n\n4. Highlight any changes to your business, including changes in your hours of operation, occupancy limits, and delivery service, to make it easy for visitors to learn what’s new. \n\n5. Craft a public announcement about your reopening. Highlight the most important details about your reopening policy and include a link to your full statement. \n\n6. Create custom graphics to go with your written announcement. \n\n7. Post your announcement on social media and email it to your list. \n\n8. If you can, spend a little money to boost your announcement post to make sure your target audience sees it. \n\n9. If your business hours have changed, make sure to update your listings on Google and crowd review sites such as Yelp, so that people who are looking for businesses like yours will have up-to-date information. \n\nAssuming it’s legal to reopen in your area, you may still have some work to do to make sure that your customers trust you to prioritize their safety. Bottom line: know who your customers are and do what you need to do to make them feel confident they can trust you. \n\nThese steps will help you reopen safely while communicating the most important information about reopening with the public. \n\nWeek 2 – Reopening \n\nWhen you reopen, you’ll need to take some steps to get people to come into your store or business. Here are some of the things you should consider during week two of your plan. \n\n1. Add some signs and notices outside of your store to let passers-by know that your business is open. This is the kind of low-key and inexpensive marketing that can make a big difference in your foot traffic. \n\n2. If necessary, include written guidelines and signs explaining the terms of your reopening. These may include: \n\n1. Occupancy limitations \n\n2. Customer requirements (wearing masks, maintaining social distancing) \n\n3. Employee requirements (not working while sick) \n\n3. Devise a marketing campaign that will incentivize your customers to come back to your business. \n\nHere are some examples of the type of campaign you might consider: \n\nA reopening sale with discounted prices. \n\nA limited-time offer on a specific product or service. \n\nA reopening event with prizes and games. \n\nFree product or service demos and training. \n\nThe option you choose should be designed to appeal to your customer base. By offering clear value and addressing their needs, you’ll be more likely to have a successful reopening. \n\nWeek 3 – Campaigning \n\nOnce you have had a successful reopening, it’s time to devise an ongoing marketing campaign to help you bring former customers into the fold and attract new customers at the same time. \n\nMarketing during a pandemic must address ongoing concerns about health and safety. You may want to create social media posts and ads to let customers know about: \n\nContactless payment options \n\nNew products or services related to the pandemic \n\nMailing lists and text notifications \n\nPick-up and delivery services \n\nDuring this time, you should also think about putting some money into a video message thanking your customers who have come back. Remember, video marketing doesn’t need to be expensive. Even a simple Facebook Live video or a video you shoot on your phone can help you connect with customers. \n\nWeek 4 – Expanding Your Base \n\nAs you move into the last week of your 30-day plan, it’s time to think about what you’ll do for the next 30 days. Here are some of the things you should prioritize. \n\n1. Ramp up your social media presence. Even after you reopen, the chances are good that your customers (and potential customers) will be spending more time on social media than usual. You can build trust and brand recognition with them by creating and sticking to a social media posting schedule. \n\n2. Share relevant information about your business as it relates to the pandemic. You may discover that you need to change certain elements of your plans (for example, altering hours or adding new precautions) as you see your plans put into action. Everything should be clearly communicated to your customers. \n\n3. Solicit opinions. As you get back to business, it’s likely that your customers will have thoughts, ideas, and requests about how you’re operating and what you could do better. You may want to consider creating a customer survey and posting it on social media or emailing it to your list. This is a good way to connect with customers and let them know you care about their opinions. \n\nThe key to a successful reopening is communication at every level. Your 30-day marketing plan should make your customers aware of how your business has and will continue to address concerns related to the pandemic. ",

      "body": "Attracting new customers is the most important marketing goal you can have. That’s what you’d think based on the way a lot of people approach marketing. \n\nBut is that the correct approach? Is your time (and money) well spent if you focus on attracting new customers? \n\nBrace yourself, because the opposite is true. You’ll get the biggest bang for your marketing buck if you make retaining existing customers a priority. \n\nThat doesn’t mean that attracting new customers is a waste of time. But it does mean that your long-term goals might be suffering as a result of your current marketing strategy. \n\nWith that in mind, let’s talk about how to calculate the value of a lifetime customer. How much is it worth to hang on to one customer? \n\nThe Cost of Acquiring New Customers \n\nYou’ve probably heard the statistics about the cost of acquiring a new customer compared to the cost of retaining an existing one – but they bear repeating. \n\nResearch shows that it costs five times as much to get a new customer to make a purchase as it does to build loyalty with the customers you already have. \n\nWhy is new customer acquisition so expensive? It makes sense if you think about it. For example: \n\nConsumers require, as a rule, 7 to 10 “touches” from a brand before they’ll make a purchase \n\nOnly a small percentage of the people who see your ads or social media posts will make a purchase \n\nThat explains it, doesn’t it? You must work hard to attract a new customer. It’s expensive. Wouldn’t you rather put your money to work keeping the customers you have? \n\nLoyalty Drives Sales \n\nWhat happens when a customer makes a purchase from you? It turns out there are some psychological quirks that kick in that make it more likely they’ll buy from you again. \n\n1. The Sunk Cost Fallacy tells us that once we’ve spent money on something, it must be a good thing. We’re more likely to give money to the same source because it reinforces our belief that we made the right decision the first time around. \n\n2. Choice-Supportive Bias is what makes us more comfortable buying familiar things than unfamiliar ones. Our reasons for buying something might not be rational, but we’d rather stick with a product we’ve already tried than choosing a new one. Think of it as “the devil you know” in action. \n\n3. In-Group Favoritism is a cognitive bias that Apple used quite effectively to create a feeling of camaraderie and superiority among their customers. In other words, identifying with the Apple brand was something that made their customers feel special – and that increased their loyalty to the brand. \n\nThe takeaway here is that one-time customers want to become repeat customers. There’s a human inclination to be loyal and to repeat behavior, and that’s one of the reasons that it’s less expensive to keep a customer than to attract a new one. \n\nWhat Your Customers Are Worth \n\nHow much is a lifetime customer worth? As you might expect, the specific answers can vary. One loyal customer might spend ten times as much as another. But that said, there are some statistics that can show you the average lifetime value of a single customer. \n\nThe initial conversion rate for any potential customer is very low – usually between 3% and 5%. However, the conversion rate goes way up when we’re talking about repeat customers. \n\nA one-time customer has a 27% chance of making a repeat purchase \n\nA two-time customer has a 45% chance of making a third purchase \n\nA three-time customer has a 54% chance of making a fourth purchase \n\nLet’s talk about what that means in practical terms. If a prospective customer has only a 3% chance of converting, it means that 97 out of 100 prospects are costing you money that you have no chance of recovering. Pretty grim, right? \n\nBut those 3 customers who do convert are nine times as likely to make a purchase as any new customer would be. Just like that, your conversion rate skyrocketed! \n\nAs you can see above, the numbers continue to increase over time. That’s due in part to repeat customers having a comfort level with your products, as we discussed above. \n\nNow, let’s use some hard numbers to get an idea of what a lifelong customer might be worth to you. Let’s say that you spend $1,000 a year on marketing to new customers, and a year, you attract 100 new customers. That means that your cost per customer acquisition is $10.00. \n\nThat number might seem high, but you can’t understand your acquisition cost without including the average purchase made by customers and the likelihood that they’ll buy from you repeatedly. \n\nIf your product sells for $20.00 with a 100% mark-up, and you spend 25% of your profits on overhead, you’re looking at an initial return of $7.50 per customer. In other words, you’ve earned back 75% of what you spent to acquire that customer. \n\nNow, let’s look at what happens if that customer buys from you repeatedly, assuming all prices, mark-ups, and overhead stay the same: \n\nIf they buy from you twice, you’ll have earned back 150% of what you spent \n\nAt three times, your ROI goes up to 225% \n\nAt four times, it increases to 300% \n\nAs you can see, each additional purchase puts you further into the black with that customer. If yours is the type of product that people buy every month or even once a year, it’s easy to see why you would want to retain that customer for as long as possible. Even if you spend a little money on email marketing or loyalty programs to help retain them, it’s still more cost-effective than it is to find new customers. \n\nConclusion \n\nAttracting new customers might feel more exciting than retaining old ones, but you’ve got to ask what’s more important to you: the thrill of attracting a new buyer, or the money that comes with retaining an existing one. Personally, we’ll take the money. ",

      "body": "Does hearing the words “Facebook content” immediately tire you out mentally? Do you cringe at the thought of having to drum up original posts every single day? \n\nLet’s be honest. Nobody really wants to do that. And there is an easier approach to Facebook content curation. It’s what we call the 70-30 approach: posting 70% original content and 30 curated content. \n\nSocial media content curation in Facebook is cost-effective and easier than having to create new posts every time, so it has fast become a part of content marketers ‘content mix. \n\nHere, we will share four of the best practices in curating great content for Facebook... \n\n#1. Use Facebook Analytics \n\nAny social media content curation strategy needs to be monitored for performance. Use Facebook’s “Pages Insights” and “Audience Insights” to give you details about your audience that will help you tailor appropriate content for them, such as age, location, gender, income, careers, and more. \n\nPages Insights will also show you important details such as which content posted on your page has performed well and what time of the day your audience usually goes online. These analytics pages can be quite confusing if you’re not used to using tools like this, so there’s definitely going to be a learning curve. \n\n#2. Go Big on Visuals \n\nThe Facebook news feed prioritizes posts accompanied with images and videos, so post photos and videos frequently. Interesting videos also receive more reach than a plain text, so curating videos is part of most marketers’ Facebook content marketing strategy. \n\nOne thing to be careful about is using photos that are legal to use or repost. This will keep you from having copyright issues. The best thing to do is to take the photos yourself, but this is not always possible, so what you can do is to look for royalty free or stock photos on stock image websites like Pixabay.com. You can also use Canva.com for free. \n\nAnother way to find publicly reusable photos is to go to Google Images, click on“Settings” which you can find just below the toolbar, then select “Advanced search”. \n\nWhat you’re looking for is “Usage rights”. Click on the dropdown box and there you will see options according to the license of the images. The safest bet is to select is “free to use, share, or modify, even commercially”, but choose according toyour needs. \n\n#3. Create a Schedule and Stick to It \n\nRegular posting of content on social media andeven in blogs is sure to get you more engagement and visibility than posting sporadically. So you need to plan your curated contents ahead, craft a schedule based on what you will learn from the Pages Insights, and stick to this schedule. \n\n#4. Use a Content Curation Platform \n\nRome wasn’t built in a week, and doing all of the tasks involved in curating great content for Facebook (and other platforms) does take time and effort. To take some of the burden off of you, consider using a content curation platform that is designed with small businesses in mind or a digital marketing service to take care of that on your behalf. \n\n“Content is exactly why your audience comes back” \n\nProducing a steady stream of quality social media content is vital these days, and it’s the driving force behind more engagement on your Facebook page, and more traffic to your website. Just remember, all you need is 70% original and 30% curated content and you’re good to go. ",

      "body": "Who doesn’t love a positive review from a satisfied customer? Every business owner knows the value of positive reviews – and they’ve never been important than they are right now. \n\nDid you know that more than 80% of all consumers say that they trust a product review from a stranger as much as they would a personal recommendation from a friend. Not only that, people trust user reviews more than the official descriptions of products. \n\nIf you’re thinking of customer reviews as something that you can’t control, think again. Business owners can do a lot to encourage reviews – and of course, you can increase the chance that most of your reviews will be positive by providing excellent quality and service. \n\nStill, those things aren’t enough. You can’t afford to sit back and hope that customers leave reviews of your business. \n\nFortunately, you don’t have to take a backseat to your customer’s whims. Here are six smart ways you can get more positive reviews online. \n\n#1: Email Customers After a Purchase \n\nDo you send customers an email after they make a purchase? \n\nI’m not talking about the confirmation email where you send them an order number if they order online. I mean an email where you specifically ask them how they like your product and request that they write a review. \n\nThis is a practice that’s become increasingly common – and for a good reason. Some people automatically leave reviews for everything. They’re the well-known Yelpers who have thousands of reviews. \n\nMany people need a reminder. They’re not going to leave a review of their own accord – but they just might if you ask them nicely. This is the review version of the call to action on your website. It’s a specific request to take a specific action. \n\nTry sending your review request email a week to ten days after the purchase. That way, the customer will have had a chance to use your product and may be ready to offer an opinion. \n\n#2: Empower Your Employees to Ask for Reviews \n\nSometimes, making the right request at the right time is all it takes to get the reviews you want. That’s why it makes sense to have your employees ask for reviews. \n\nSome Uber drivers do this. Just before they arrive at their passenger’s destination, they ask about the review. The simple request puts the idea of leaving a review in the customer’s mind and greatly increases the chances that they’ll comply and leave a review. \n\nWhy ask at the point of service? When a customer has just made a purchase or used your service, the experience is fresh. A cashier who provides a friendly checkout and some banter is ideally placed to ask for a review because they have an opportunity to build rapport with the customer. \n\nIf you decide to use this method of getting reviews, consider printing cards asking for reviews and putting links to your review pages on your website. You don’t want customers to be confused about what to do – so eliminate the guesswork and you’ll reap the rewards. \n\n#3: Use a Reviews Provider \n\nAre you selling products from well-known brand names? If you are, you might benefit from using a reviews provider like Bazaarvoice or Revoo to build up reviews on your product page. \n\nThe benefit of using these providers is that they can get you a bunch of reviews at once. They’re real reviews from real people and they can give your page instant credibility. \n\nThe downside is that the reviews aren’t from your customers. They’re from people who have bought the product – and they’re all verified. That’s the good part. The less-great part is that they can’t and won’t be providing reviews of YOUR business, including your ambience, customer service, and other key drivers of business. \n\nThese providers are a good option for start-up businesses because they can make your website appear to be well-established and popular. As you go, you can supplement the reviews you get through a service with new reviews from your customers. \n\n#4: Try to Get a Google Local Guide to Review Your Company \n\nGoogle Local Guide is a program owned by Google that designates certain reviewers as local experts. \n\nThe process of getting a local guide can be a complex one, but here are some tips to help you do it: \n\nMake sure your Google My Business listing is up-to-date and active \n\nJoin Google Local Guides on your own – you can write reviews of local businesses and raise your visibility provided you don’t use the platform to promote or favor your business \n\nAttend local events with other guides \n\nInvite other guides to come to your business \n\nThis isn’t a quick fix, but the nice thing about Google Local Guides is that when a local guide reviews your business, their designation shows up in the review and that gives it more weight than it would have otherwise. Another benefit is that Google requires guides to use their real names, so there’s less of the anonymous ranting that shows up on Yelp. \n\n#5: Automate the Asking Process \n\nIf there’s a way for you to automate the process of asking for reviews, why wouldn’t you do it? \n\nAutomation means that there’s no worry that a stressed-out employee will forget to ask. It turns the process into part of your customer service – a hands-off way of encouraging customer feedback and garnering the kinds of reviews you want. \n\nHere are a few suggestions to help you automate your system: \n\nSet up an autoresponder to send an email requesting a review. Instead of manually sending those emails, link the date of a customer’s purchase to their email and have it go out on schedule. If you link customer purchases to your email marketing provider, you can rest easy knowing that every customer will get a request for a review. \n\nPrint up review request cards and put them in the customer’s bag at checkout. This method eliminates the need for your cashier to ask for a review, and makes it simple to do even at times when you’re busy and have a line at the register. \n\nPut review links on your product pages. That way, when a customer makes a purchase they can easily read reviews of it – and it may help to remind them to leave a review after their purchase. \n\nAutomating your review request system makes good business sense because it eliminates the guesswork. \n\n#6: Set Up a Review System in Your Company \n\nEven if your business is small, you shouldn’t fly by the seat of your pants when you’re requesting reviews. The method you use to ask for reviews should be part of your company’s standard operating procedures. \n\nYour review system should: \n\nSpecify whose job it is to ask for reviews \n\nSpecify the language to be used when requesting a review \n\nSpecify methods to be used (email, conversation, links and printed cards, to name a few) \n\nSpecify the timeframe for requesting reviews \n\nLay out procedures for responding to both positive and negative reviews \n\nIf you codify your system for requesting and managing reviews, you can be sure that there isn’t any confusion and that customers always get the request you want them to get. \n\nDon’t Sweat the Negative Reviews... \n\nWe’ve focused here on garnering positive reviews for your business, but don’t get too stressed about negative reviews. If you handle them properly, they can help your business too! \n\nRespond quickly and graciously and offer solutions. Don’t get defensive. Many businesses use negative feedback to demonstrate that they care about their customers. \n\nIf you’re getting so many reviews that you’re having trouble keeping up, you may want to consider using an online review management system to help you – and having too many reviews is the problem you want to have! That’s how businesses grow. ",
